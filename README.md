Here's an example of payloads that could be used in a chatbot

1. **Fuzzing Payload**: `'!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:",.<>?/'`
2. **SQL Injection Payload**: `' OR '1'='1`
3. **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Payload**: `'<script>alert("XSS")</script>'`
4. **Command Injection Payload**: `'; shutdown --'`
5. **Format String Payload**: `'%s %s %s %s'`
6. **Overflow Payload**: `'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'` (length varies based on the buffer size expected)
7. **Recursive Payload**: `'(repeat("hello", 1000000))'` (custom function to trigger recursion)
8. **Logic Bomb Payload**: `'if (date == "01-01-2025") { crash(); }'` (date-specific condition)
9. **Time-based Payload**: `'sleep(10000)'` (causing a delay to test timeout handling)
10. **AI-specific Payload**: `'This statement is false.'` (a paradox to test AI's logical handling)
